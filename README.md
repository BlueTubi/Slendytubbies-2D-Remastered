This is a remaster version of ST2D (It's 100% totally a small project). I'm making this because why not (and I love to suffer by having multiple projects to do, for example ST3 on Android (Campaign and Multiplayer), STAEM, STNC and etc.), feel free to give any ideas in "Issues" which I should add. I will upload releases here, on GitHub, not on mediafire, so yeah. If there is any bugs or something like that (when the game will be released), then type them in "Issues". You can fork it if you want **Unity 2017.4.40f1 is required** (it will be very useful for you if you want to show your ideas in game, you can upload your videos of your showcases and when I will have free time, I will watch them).

(README.md will be updated over time (you can also correct any mistakes I have done in README.md), so yeah)
